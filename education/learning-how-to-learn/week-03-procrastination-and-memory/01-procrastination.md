Procrastination
===============

-   Building significant chunks in memory takes time.

Tackling Procrastination - It's Easier, and More Valuable, than you think
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The pomodoro technique is a useful technique to battle
    procrastination
-   Learning to avoid procrastination is very important because we learn
    bit by bit - cramming won't help you learn in the long run.
-   Willpower is hard to come by - it uses a lot of resources
-   We procrastinate about:
    -   Things that make use unhappy.
    -   This makes us shift to a more pleasant task
    -   Causing a temporary happiness
    -   but a lasting unhappiness
-   **Procrastination is a habit**.
-   Procrastination offers temporary excitement and relief in lieu of
    what we really want.
-   Gradually procrastinating creates major long-term effects that
    aren't good.

Zombies Everywhere
------------------

-   Zombie mode - where your mind is only focused on very minor cues of
    information, instead of dealing with information overload.
-   Habit - purpose is to allow you go into zombie mode and not worry
    about every step.
-   Habits have four parts:
    1.  The cue
        -   Any information to trigger a habit

    2.  The routine
        -   The actual habit

    3.  The reward
        -   Every habit we do, we do because it triggers a reward

    4.  The belief
        -   Habits have power because of our belief in them

Process vs. Product
-------------------

-   It's normal to feel unhappy about starting a new habit
-   More successful people get over it
-   Focus on **process**, not **product**.
    -   "I'm going to spend 20 minutes working" instead of "I'm going to
        finish my homework."
    -   The product triggers the pain in our head.
    -   The process often doesn't trigger this pain feeling.
-   Focus on doing a pomodoro - not on completing whatever the task is.
-   It's easier to enlist a friendly zombie habit when focusing on a
    process
-   When a distraction arises, train yourself to just let if flow by.
    -   Setting yourself up so distractions can't often come by (if you
        can't see it, it's not a temptation).

Harnessing your zombies to help you
-----------------------------------

-   The trick to overwriting a habit is change your reaction to the cue.
-   Steps
    1.  The cue
        -   Location
        -   Time
        -   How you feel
        -   Reactions
        -   These are possible to prevent by limiting the possibility of
            them showing up. Often, procrastination occurs without
            us noticing.

    2.  The routine
        -   **Plan**
        -   Your brain wants to automatically go into a routine when it
            recognizes a cue. Try to develop a new ritual.

    3.  The reward
        -   Create a small reward for your procrastination.
        -   Why are you procrastinating? Can you substitute or create a
            useful reward?
        -   Only when your brain recognizes the reward does rewiring
            begin to occur.
        -   The better you get at something, the more enjoyable
            it becomes.

    4.  The belief
        -   When the going gets stressful, it's easy to go back to
            old habits.
        -   Develop a new community

Juggling Life and Learning
--------------------------

-   Write a brief weekly list of key tasks
-   Daily "to do" list
    -   Try to write this the evening before
        -   Writing the list the night before enlists your zombies to
            think about them subconsciously
    -   Once you have a task list, it frees your working memory
-   Mix up other tasks with your learning that can engage the diffuse
    mode
-   **Plan your quitting time!**
    -   You can almost always finish everything you want.
-   Those who are committed to maintaining healthy leisure time
    outperform those who don't.
-   Squeeze in break time.
-   Eat your frogs first in the morning
    -   Focus on your most important and most disliked task first (at
        least one pomodoro in the morning).
-   Planning well is part of trying - **invoke the Law of Serendipity**.

Summing up Procrastination
--------------------------

-   Learning often involves bit-by-bit, day-by-day steps
-   Keep a planner journal
    -   Observe what and what doesn't work.
-   Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day.
-   Allow you and your zombies to get many rewards
-   Delay rewards until you finish the task
-   Watch for procrastination cues
-   Gain trust in your new system
-   Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate
-   Eat your frogs first, everyday.
