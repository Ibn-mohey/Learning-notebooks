# Seeing the Bigger Picture

## What Motivates You

* It is hard to learn if you aren't interested, but it's usually easy if you 
  are.
* Neurons in our cortex carry information about what is going on around us, and
  what we are doing.
* Neuromodulators carry information not about content, but its importance to 
  us and our future
* Neuromodulators are chemicals that affect how chemicals that influence how a
  neuron responds to other neurons.
    - Acetylcholine
        + A chemical produced by acetylcholine neurons
        + Project widely
        + Help long-term memory
    - Dopamine
        + Found in our brain stem
        + Controls reward learning
        + Basal ganglia
        + Released when we get an unexpected reward
        + Affects decision making
        + Predicts future rewards, and not just the immediate
        + Addictive drugs artificially increase dopamine activity. 
            * Leads to cravings and lack of free will
        + Severe loss of dopamine creates Parkinson's disease
            * Ultimately leads to catatonia
    - Serotonin
        + Alpha male has highest serotonin
        + Closely linked to depression and risk-taking behavior
        + Inmates often have the lowest levels of serotonin
        + Very socially related

## The Value of a Library of Chunks: Compaction, Transfer, Creativity, and the Law of Serendipity

* Gradually building the number of chunks in your mind help you build major
  connections across your subjects.
* Chunking is a very important component of overall learning.
* Chunks can often be related to similar chunks (called **Transfer**), even if they
  are a part of other fields.
* The chunks you are able to create get bigger over time.
* A large set of chunks can form a library. Through diffuse thinking, they
  can connect multiple chunks (instead of individual ideas).
* If you don't practice your chunks, they fade away.
* There are two ways to solve a problem
    1. Sequential thinking
        - Each small steps leads to a solution
        - Focused mode
    2. Holistic ("global")
        - Intuition
        - New ideas often a small leap away from the solution
    - Ideas from holistic should be analyzed greatly in focused mode. Intuition
      is not always correct.
* **Law of Serendipity**: Lady Luck favors the one who tries.
    - Focus on whatever you are studying. Once you put a problem into your
      library. Following concepts will become easier over time.

## Overlearning, Choking, the Eintellung Effect, and Interleaving

* **Overlearning**: Continuing to practice what you've mastered in a session.
* Repetitive overlearning in a single session is a waste of time.
* Continuing to repeat something you've already mastered in a single session 
  does not strengthen the memory at all.
* Using a subsequent study session strengthens and deepens neural connections, 
  but if it's already perfected, then it just becomes easy and is a waste of 
  time.
* Balance studies by deliberately focusing on what's more difficult.
* **Deliberate Practice**: Focusing on the subjects you find more difficult.
* **Einstellung**
    - An idea already thought and mastered may actually prevent you from 
      learning something better (or more correct).
    - "Installing a roadblock because of the way you first look at it."
    - To fix: unlearn or move away to re-think fresh
* Once you have the basic idea of learning something, you should start
  interleaving it with problems of a different type.
    - Mixing up strengthens your context strength of ideas.
    - Helps learn more deeply.
* Practice and repetition helps build strong neural patterns, interleaving
  helps to strengthen knowledge of when to use those patterns.
* Interleaving within a subject develops creative power within the subject.
    - Across multiple subjects, this enhances major creativity across multiple
      fields.
* Most paradigm shifts are brought about by people not too entrenched in 
  previous trainings.

## Summary

* Chunks are a small network of neurons that compact many small ideas. 
    - Chunks can concatenate other chunks.
* Recall
    - Trying to remember keypoints without re-reading
    - Try recalling in different places from where you originall re-learned
* Transfer
    - Idea that the chunk you learned in one area can relate to a chunk in 
      another
* Interleaving
    - Practice multiple ideas in the same setting
* Chunks don't necessarily provide flexibility
* Illusions of Competence
    - Test yourself frequently to see if you are actually learning
    - Recall is a form of mini-testing
    - Don't depend on highlighting too much
    - Learn from your mistakes
    - Use deliberate practice
* Einstellung
    - When your original thought prevents a better idea or solution from being
      found.
* Law of Serendepity
    - Try with one single idea, then add another, and continue
