Study Guide for Learning How to Learn
=====================================

This is, essentially, a high-level summary of everything learned in the
class. For more detailed notes, please either review my actual notes, or
take the course!

Modes of Thinking
=================

There are two modes of thinking: the focused and diffuse modes.

-   Focused
    -   Tight spacing to keep thoughts concentrated.
    -   Related to focusing on tasks you are already familiar with
    -   Like a pinball machine with very close bumpers
-   Diffuse
    -   Wider spacing; allows bigger range of thinking
    -   Related to learning something new
    -   Representative of the brain's many neural resting states
    -   Like a pinball machine with very far-apart bumpers

You cannot be in both modes at the same time. However, there are tricks
to use effectively.

-   Enter the diffuse mode via exercise, sleep, shower, etc. -- anything
    that doesn't require focus.
-   Before entering diffuse mode, use the focused mode to prime your
    brain to subconsciously think about what you are trying
    to understand.

Habits
======

-   The purpose of a habit is to allow you to go into **zombie mode**
    (where your mind is only focused on very minor cues of information),
    and not worry about all the steps.
-   Four parts of a habit:
    1.  The cue
        -   Location, time, feeling, reactions

    2.  The routine
        -   Brain wants to enter upon seeing a cue.
        -   Is trainable to change this.

    3.  The reward
        -   Create a small reward. Only when brain recognizes does
            rewiring occur.

    4.  The belief (that the habit works)
        -   Your brain will believe a habit works once it gets used
            to it.

Procrastination
===============

-   *Procrastination is a habit*.
-   Occurs because the product we are trying to achieve makes
    us unhappy.
    -   Use willpower to overcome, **ONLY** at the cue (willpower is a
        limited, valuable resource).
-   **Pomodoro Technique**: Used to prevent procrastination.
    1.  Set a timer for 25 minutes to work and be focused (turn off all
        potential distractions).
    2.  Once over, set a timer for 5 minutes to take a small break and
        reward yourself.
    3.  Repeat. After every 4th Pomodoro, take a 15 minute break instead
        of 5.
-   Focus on the **process**, instead of product.
    -   "I'm going to spend 20 minutes working" instead of "I'm going to
        finish my homework".
    -   Focus on the pomodoro, not the goal.
-   Set yourself up to have minimal distractions. If one occurs, let it
    just flow by.

Memory
======

Two types of memory:

-   Long-term memory
    -   Like a storage warehouse.
    -   Spaced repetition helps retain memories longer (gives them
        more definition).
    -   Allowable via the hippocampus.
    -   Memories are not fixed. They can be chaned through
        **reconsolidation**.
    -   Short-term -&gt; consolidation -&gt; long-term -&gt; recall
        -&gt; short term -&gt; reconsolidation -&gt; long-term
-   Working memory
    -   Like a chalkboard.
    -   Only 4 slots (on average).
    -   Chunks help condense ideas into a single slot
-   Tips/Tricks
    -   Spaced Repetition
        -   Practice recalling over time (not all at once).
        -   Flashcards, Anki, etc.
    -   Visual Memory System
        -   Create a memorable image of what you are trying to remember.
            The funnier or more evocative, the better.
    -   Memory palace
        -   Good for grouping unrelated items.
        -   Think of a familiar place and put objects of memory into the
            place
    -   Mnemonics
        -   Good to remember lists

Sleep
=====

-   Extremely important for the brain. Removes toxic products in
    the brain.
-   Erases less-important memories and strengthens important memories.
    -   Rehearses patterns it noticed during the day.
-   Enter focused mode before sleep and it primes brain for
    diffuse mode.

Chunking
========

-   **Chunking** is the unity of multiple bits of information.
-   Combines multiple ideas into one, so only uses 1 slot of working
    memory

**How to form a chunk:**

1.  Focus on the individual idea you want to chunk.
2.  Understand the basic idea.
3.  Gain context
    -   See both how and when to use the chunk

4.  Practice

-   **Transfer**: when a chunk is related to a similar chunk of
    another field.
-   **Interleaving**: Practice multiple, different ideas in the
    same sitting.
-   A large set of chunks forms a library that can be connected in
    diffuse mode.
-   If you don't practice chunks, they fade away.
-   Two ways to solve a problem:
    1.  Sequential thinking
    2.  Holistic thinking
-   **Law of Serendipity**: Lady Luck favors the one who tries.

Illusion of Competence
======================

-   **Illusion of Competence**: When you believe content is in your
    brain, but you are not actually engraining it.
    -   Like if you have a book open, but aren't
        actually reading/studying.

Ineffective methods of studying:

-   Re-reading the text.
    -   Only useful if significant time has passed. **Recall** is much
        more effective.
-   Highlighting/underlining frequently.
    -   Margin writing is much more effective.
-   Looking at a solution without really trying.
    -   Should try your hardest and only when you've truly failed, look
        (and understand).
-   Practicing concepts you already understand.
    -   Use **deliberate practice** to focus on only the hard problems.

Overlearning
============

-   **Overlearning**: Continuing to practice what you've already
    mastered in a session.
    -   This is a waste of time. Doesn't strengthen the memory at all.
-   **Einstellung**: When your original thought prevents a better idea
    or solution to be found.
-   Once you understand the basic ideas of learning something, it's good
    to interleave with problems of a different type.
    -   Develops creative power and trains your mind to recognize types
        of problems.
