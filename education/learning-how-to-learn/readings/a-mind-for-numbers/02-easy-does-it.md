# Chapter 2: Easy Does It: When Trying Too Hard Can Sometimes be Part of the Problem -- Notes

* **Tip**: Prime your mental pump
    - Before reading a chapter, take a picture walk: look at various diagrams,
      headings, etc. and briefly skim over. This doesn't give understanding,
      but it primes your neural hooks to be ready to take in the information.

## Focused vs. Diffuse Thinking

### The Focused Mode -- A Tight Pinball Machine

# Personal Summary

**Disclaimer**: These notes may be completely incorrect. They are written from 
memory, as this is a useful technique for learning. However, they are nowhere
near verbatim. There is a succeeding section that includes any notes that I
got wrong or missed.
