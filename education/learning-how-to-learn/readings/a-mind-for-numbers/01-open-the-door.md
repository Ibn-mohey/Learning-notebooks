* Learned when/how to study but also when to quit.

# Personal Summary

**Disclaimer**: These notes may be completely incorrect. They are written from 
memory, as this is a useful technique for learning. However, they are nowhere
near verbatim. There is a succeeding section that includes any notes that I
got wrong or missed.

Barbara Oakley never did well in math/science, but she did well in humanities/
social studies/language/etc. She went into the army and learned Russion well,
eventually earning her bachelor's in Slavic. Then, she was forced to learn a
technology with radio and communications equipment in the army, which was a 
challenge. Because she couldn't find great work after this, she used her 
cheaper education thanks to the army to go back to school and learn technology,
studying electrical engineering and subsequently electrical and computer 
engineering for her PhD. 

Through these new subjects, she learned both how to study and how to quit. 
It's possibly to train yourself to learn and love new subjects, even if they
are completely abstract to you. There are tips/tricks to develop this.
