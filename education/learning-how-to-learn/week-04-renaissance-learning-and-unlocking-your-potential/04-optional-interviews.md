How NOT to Take a Test w/ Dr. Richard Felder and Dr. Rebecca Brent
------------------------------------------------------------------

**How NOT to Take a Test**

-   Read the book like a novel
-   Underline the book while reading
-   Read through old homework solutions like a novel
-   Keep bashing against a problem you can't solve.

**How to Prepare for a Test**

-   Set problems up
    -   Solve them yourself
-   Don't waste your time on basic steps (algebra, etc.)
-   Work with other people
    -   Try to find someone smarter than you are so they can help if you
        get stuck
-   Try out what works for you and keep practicing that so you can use
    it during the test.

**How to Take a Test**

-   Take a moment to look through entire test to see where you're going.
-   Start with easy questions
-   If stuck, go on to something else you know -- **keep moving**.
-   **Partial credit exists!**
-   Stop, take a deep breath -- calming down is very important.
-   If you get stuck, come back - the diffuse mode will work on it.

Learning Something New, w/ Dr. Richard Felder and Dr. Rebecca Brent
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Usually, you need to learn by doing.
-   Teach!
    -   Needing to learn how to explain a difficult concept teaches you
        how to actually understand the information.
-   Use whatever resources are available
    -   The text
    -   Teachers
    -   Internet
-   The Illusion of Competence
    -   Re-watch lectures or re-read
    -   The best way to get over the illusion of competence is to just
        do the problems. Keep doing it until you can do it un-aided,
        because only then are you actually competent.
-   Ask "what are the things the teacher might be asking me?" while
    reading or going over lectures/homework.

The Imposter Syndrome and Dealing with Procrastination, w/ Dr. Richard Felder and Dr. Rebecca Brent
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Imposter Syndrome**

-   The Imposter Syndrome is when you think everyone else is better
    than yourself. As if you were never meant to be there. You are
    a fraud.
    -   It's a scam. You didn't get in if you weren't adequate.
-   Most people suffer from the imposter syndrome.
-   Remind yourself when you see the **cue** of Imposter Syndrome
    habit - "*It's the imposter!*"

**Procrastination**

-   Schedule a small amount of time to work everyday on a big task.
-   Keep a to-do list.
    -   Break into small pieces.
-   It's very hard to get started on a difficult task - if you break
    into small tasks, it's really easy.
-   **Make appointments with yourself.**
-   Accountability is also helpful.

Writer John Maguire on the Importance of Putting Objects in Your Writing
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Think about objects more than you think about ideas.
-   It's easy to express ideas in terms of objects
-   It's easy to get overwhelmed with idea words
    -   When your writing becomes really abstract, it becomes very
        difficult for both the reader and writer to understand what you
        are trying to say.
-   When writing about ideas, go down the "Abstraction ladder" -&gt;
    from idea to things, **always**!
-   Any creative person switches from focused to diffuse modes well and
    learns how to do it easily.
-   In your writing, put in:
    -   Things
    -   Active verbs
    -   People
    -   Short words &gt; long words
    -   Short sentences &gt; long sentences
-   English people prefer clarity over impressiveness
    -   "*Once you learn how to write clear, you will be impressive.*"
-   Just try to be clear while writing.
-   Do not edit as you write.
    -   Writing is about getting ideas on the screen. It's supposed to
        just be considered a brain dump.
    -   Editing is meant to be for fixing **later**.
-   Edit on paper as well. Then, add the fixes on the computer later.
-   Read closely those writers you admire and take their use
    as inspiration.
    -   Study their sentence length
    -   Study their vocabulary
-   A good writer is always thinking about their readers.
-   Visual metaphors are very useful.
-   It's more important to get the words down as a writer.
-   When you have too little to say, often it means you are thinking
    too narrowly. Shift your focus on other ideas and see how to
    connect them.

**Final Major Thoughts**

-   Use short sentences
-   Ask yourself
    -   What am I trying to say? Did I say it clearly?
    -   What must I not leave out?
-   Paint pictures with words

William Craig Rice on Learning in the Humanities
------------------------------------------------

-   He starts with **noticing**.
    -   When you notice something, just mark it.
-   Look for **patterns**.
-   Be focused more on questions than answers
    -   Understand and be okay with this
-   Be open to contrarian evidence
-   Read
-   Take Notes
-   Be okay with being alone while studying the humanities
-   Ask for or find conflicting interpretations of what you are trying
    to learn
    -   Ask what are the major points of contention
    -   Who has the better evidence
    -   Who is stronger?
-   **Do not focus on what your own thoughts are - focus on the evidence
    given**.
-   Think about the context of "why something was written"?
-   **Write a summary of everything you read**.
    -   You learn the material much better by reflecting upon it.
-   Discipline-specific learning
    -   Not all skills are transferable.
    -   Accept it!
-   Recognize when you are delving into Einstellung.
-   The best humanitarians have great respect for understanding "what
    they don't know."
    -   There is a lack of recognition, but it's important to know what
        ways **don't work**.
-   When something is controversial, take the information you are
    receiving with a grain of salt -- it's not always correct, and
    likely to have a significant bias.
-   Read biographies!
