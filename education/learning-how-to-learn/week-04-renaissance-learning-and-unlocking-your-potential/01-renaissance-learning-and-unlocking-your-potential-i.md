Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential I
===================================================

How to Become a Better Learner
------------------------------

-   The best gift you can give your brain is physical exercise.
-   The hippocampus is very important for learning new things.
-   Exercise helps new neurons survive!
-   Exercise is more effective than any drug on the market today for
    brain development.
-   Gym/recess are possibly the most important parts of curriculum.
-   The critical period for language acquisition extends up to puberty.
-   You can practice to both "repair/train" the brain.
-   Zombies cannot learn.
-   Learning/planning/language are the skills that make us human
-   The pre-frontal cortex is involved in complex analysis, social
    behaviors, decision making and planning.
    -   The last part to mature
-   Good judgment takes a long time and a lot of experience to acquire.

Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-   Learn using metapher and analogy
-   Work profitably with teammates
-   Perform well on tests

-   Learning doesn't progress logically - each day doesn't add a new
    package to your knowledge shelf.
-   Knowledge collapse occurs when your mind is re-structuring.
-   It takes time to assimilate knowledge.
-   You WILL experience a time where what you are learning (and what
    seemed easy before) seems very difficult and you take a huge step
    back - this is a natural phenomenon that means the mind is wrestling
    deeply from the material. Once over, the knowledge base takes a
    surprising leap forward.

Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy
------------------------------------------

-   Metaphors are one of the best ways to both remember and understand.
    -   More visual the better.
-   Metaphors and visualization are well-known for making major progress
-   It's useful to imagine you are part of the image.
-   Metaphors are never perfect.
-   Models are vitally important in giving a central idea in the
    process/concept you are trying to understand.
-   Metaphors proven to help significantly in preventing Einstellung.
-   Stories can more easily help you retain as well.
-   Metaphors help glue an idea into your mind. They give you a sense of
    what's going on.

No Need for Genius Envy
-----------------------

-   A point of chunking is so you don't need to revisit individual
    memories so often -- you can recall "chunks" of them at a single
    time instead.
-   People learn by trying to make sense of the information they
    are receiving.
-   Well-trained experts often don't think consciously, but rely on the
    chunks already engrained in the subconscious mind.
-   Intelligence matters - being smarter often includes a larger
    working memory.
    -   But, it also inhibits ability to be creative.
        Promotes Einstellung.
-   Having a smaller working memory often means you have to creatively
    generate ways of chunking those items - often boosts creativity.
-   Deliberate practice can lift average brains into the realm of
    the gifted.
    -   Very much like lifting heavy weights
-   You are not alone -- you aren't an **imposter**!.
-   **Imposter Syndrome**

Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life
--------------------------------------

-   Myelin sheaths don't finish developing until the 20's
    -   explains why teenagers can't control themselves
-   When you use neural connections, myelin sheaths develop
    better/faster
-   Practice develops this
-   You can enhance the development of neuronal circuits by practicing
-   Anyone can change their own brain so even the least gifted can
    produce similar output as that of a very gifted person.
-   Taking responsibility for your own learning is one of the most
    important things you can do.
-   It's important to cut people out if their interests are to
    undercut you.
-   You can take pride in achieving success.
