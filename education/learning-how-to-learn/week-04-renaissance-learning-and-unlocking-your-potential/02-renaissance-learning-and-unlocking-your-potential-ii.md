Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential II
====================================================

The Value of Teamwork
---------------------

-   The right-hemisphere allows us to step back and gain big-picture
    concepts
-   When you finish a problem and don't revisit to check your work, then
    you are refusing to use part of your brain. You need to revisit with
    the bigger picture in mind to see if it makes sense.
-   The left hemisphere interprets the world for us.
-   When in the focused mode, it's easy to make a minute mistake that
    makes the rest of your answer wrong.
    -   It provides an analytical approach which is useful, but can
        allow the ego to grow.
-   One of the best ways to catch an error is to brainstorm and meet
    with others to review, analyze, and collaborate with.
-   It's sometimes important to study with friends/teammates to see the
    bigger picture with a POV that isn't stuck to your own mind.
-   If study sessions turn into social settings, then they are
    **useless**.

A Test Checklist
----------------

-   Testing is an extraordinarily powerful learning tool
-   1 hour taking a test &gt; 1 hour studying (proven)

### The Checklist of Questions

Developed by Dr. Richard Felder.

*The answer to the question "How should I prepare for a test?" is "Do
whatever it takes to be able to answer it yes on all of the following
questions."*

-   Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
-   Did you work with classmates on homework problems?
    -   Or at least check solutions with others?
-   Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution?
-   Did you participate actively in homework group discussions?
-   Did you consult with the instructor when you had trouble and needed
    help?
-   Did you understand ALL of your homework problem solutions?
-   Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions
    that weren't clear to you?
-   Did you have a study guide? Did you carefully go through it before
    the test?
-   Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly?
    -   Without spending time on algebra/calculations?
-   Did you go over the study guide and problems with classmates and
    quiz one another?
-   Did you attend a review session/ask questions?
-   Did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test?
    -   If your answer here is **no**, then the answers to the previous
        questions likely don't matter.

Hard Start - Jump to Easy
-------------------------

-   For most people, starting with the easy problem and moving to the
    hard is not productive at all.
-   Start with the hard problems, and then quickly jump to the
    easy problems.
    -   When you get a test, look through the questions to see what is
        involved first.
    -   Then, start with what appears the hardest problem.
    -   If you get stuck, pull back and then try an easier problem.
    -   This works, because it loads the harder problem into your mind
        (from the focused mode) and then places it in the back of your
        head (diffuse mode) to begin its work.
    -   Since you know the easier problem (mostly), you don't have to
        think as much.
    -   The more difficult problem may be slightly clearer when you
        return to it.
-   Hard start, jump to easy guarantees that you will have a little work
    done on every problem.
    -   Helps prevent Einstellung as well.
    -   **Extremely useful if you get partial credit.**
    -   The only trick is that you need self-discipline to pull yourself
        off a problem once you get stuck.
-   This is an example of when you think of the solution after turning
    in a test - the diffuse mode is active and working. If you engage in
    the middle of the test, you may be able to tap into this before it's
    too late.
-   Statistically, this method doesn't end up providing confusion (a
    major concern of others). To ensure this, try practicing with
    practice quizzes or homework problems to get a feel for it first.

Final Helpful Hints for Tests
-----------------------------

-   When under stress, the body produces cortisol. Causes sweaty palms,
    racing heart, etc. It's how we interpret these symptoms makes a
    major difference.
    -   If you interpret stress as fear, it is detrimental.
    -   If you trick yourself to interpret stress as excitement, it can
        improve performance greatly.
-   Breathing
    -   Relax stomach, place hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath.
    -   Your hand should move out on stomach, not chest.
    -   Practice this in the weeks before your test so you know how to
        do it during your test.
    -   Also, do it right before the test is handed out to calm down.
-   Try consciously relaxing your tongue.

Tips from other experts:

-   Cover up the answers to multiple-choice questions
    -   Requires you to recall and answer first -- then, if that answer
        is there, you know which one is right.
-   Try to replicate test-taking scenarios as best as possible
-   Face your fears
    -   Have a "plan B" for the worst possible contingency. This
        subsides fear.
    -   Let it go when you hit the test.
        -   This releases stress, and moves you towards your "plan A"
-   "Good worry" vs "Bad Worry"
    -   Good worry provides motivation and focus
    -   Bad worry wastes energy
-   The day before a test, have a quick final look over materials
    -   Use both focused and diffuse mode muscles the day of the test,
        so you don't want to work too hard while doing this.
        -   You wouldn't run 10 miles the day before a half marathon
-   During the test, double check your answers (after a brief break from
    that question)
    -   Ask: Does this really make sense?

Summary
-------

-   Create a metaphor or analogy for what you're learning.
-   If you change your thoughts, you can change your life.
    -   You can enhance the development of your neural development by
        practicing the processes that use these circuits.
-   Take pride in your success
-   If you whiz through homework and don't go back to check, you're
    acting like a person who isn't using parts of their brain.
-   Overconfidence in your results can result from using only one mode
    of thinking.
    -   Study with friends occassionally to get a fresh POV.
-   Go through the test preparation checklist to vastly improve chance
    of success.
-   Hard start -- then jump to easy.
-   The body puts out chemicals when it's under stress. You can choose
    to interpret those changes from "this test makes me afraid" to "this
    is making me excited", you can handle the stress and improve
    your outlook.
-   If panicked on a test, turn your attention to your breathing for
    about 90 seconds.
-   Double-check your answers using a big picture perspective to ask if
    it really makes sense.
-   Get enough sleep. Without enough sleep, all other efforts are
    deemed moot.

Wrapup to the Course
--------------------

-   Switching from focused to reduced mode can increase understanding.
-   Chunking gives a firmer understanding of the material.
-   Tiny changes in daily work (like pomodoro technique) makes a drastic
    change in your outlook on learning.
-   Focus on the learning process - not the product.
-   You have not truly learned something unless you can teach it
    to others.
