Summary - Module 1
==================

-   People have two fundamentally different modes of thinking
    -   Focused
        -   Tight spacing to help keep thoughts concentrated.
        -   Pre-frontal cortex.
        -   Related to focusing on tasks you are already familiar with
            (at least a little bit).
    -   Diffuse
        -   Wider spacing to help bigger ranges of thinking.
        -   More related to learning something new.
        -   Representative of the brain's many neural resting states.
-   Creative thinkers throughout history have all learned how to access
    the diffuse mode quickly.
    -   We do this by going for a walk or drifting to sleep.
    -   When stuck on a problem, it's a good idea after focusing on the
        situation, sit back and drift into a diffuse mode.
    -   It takes time for neural structures to build.
-   Tackling procrastination is extremely important.
    -   Use the pomodoro technique
-   Through practice and repetition we help develop our neural
    structures and patterns to be strongest.
    -   More important for more abstract topics
-   Memory
    -   Working Memory
        -   There are four slots in our working memory.
        -   Like a poorly made blackboard
        -   Ideas can fall out of our slots unless we keep repeating
            them
    -   Long-term Memory
        -   Like a storage warehouse
    -   Enough repetition and practice can transfer ideas from working
        memory to long-term memory
        -   This can be best achieved through spaced repetition.
        -   Don't try cramming information
-   Sleep
    -   Washes away brain toxins
-   Exercise
    -   Surprisingly valuable
    -   Improves our memory and ability to learn
