# Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

## Introduction: Focused and diffuse modes

* We have two modes of thinking
    - Focused
        + Concentration intently on something we are trying to learn
    - Diffuse
        + Relaxed
        + Related to neural resting states
* Both metaphor and analogy are very useful when trying to learn something new
* Pinball analogy
    - Focused
        + Pins very close together
        + Think a thought, bounces around frequently
        + Misses opportunity to reach thoughts that haven't been thought before
    - Diffuse
        + Widely spaced bumpers
        + Thought moves widley across bumpers
        + Look at things broadly (big picture)
        + Can't focus in tightly, but can move into the place necessary. 
* Neural scientists so far theorize you can only be in one or the other of 
  these thinking modes.

## Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes

* Salvador Dali and Edison had methods to switch from Diffuse to Focused modes.
    - Would sit in a chair and hold onto something in a hand. While thinking
      and inevitably drifting to sleep, they would be in the diffuse mode of
      thinking at that point. The object would fall, waking them. Then, they'd
      be able to hone in on the last thoughts they had and be in focused mode
      with them.
* Our mind needs to be able to switch between focused and diffuse modes in 
  order to learn effectively (and efficiently). 
* Similar to bodybuilders, to build neural strength, we need to grow a little
  bit everyday (as opposed as to say, cramming the night before). 
* Note: Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning.
* Learning something difficult takes time!

## What is Learning?

* The brain is the most complex device in the known universe.
* Activities that seem simple to us are actually very complex (seeing, 
  smelling, running, etc.)
* We are not conscience (nor should we be) of the functions our brain is doing
  at any given moment.
* There are lots of synapses in the brain (million billion).
* Brain connectivity is dynamic.
    - Syanpses turnover (create and destroy) often
        + How do memories stay then?
* During sleep, synapses are "knitted up" and "weaved together" to create 
  strong bonds. New synapses also created. Thus you are "not the same person"
  after a sleep as you were before sleep.
