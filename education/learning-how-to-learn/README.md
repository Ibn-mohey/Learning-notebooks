Learning How to Learn
=====================

Course Information
------------------

-   Course: [Learning How to
    Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
-   School: [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/)
-   Instructors: Barbara Oakley, Terry Sejnowski

Structure
---------

This course follows a week-based structure. Notes are templated as:

`/week-{week number}-{lesson title}/{lecture number}-{lecture title}.md`

Week and lecture numbers are always 2-digit numbers, due to the common
occurrence of a course taking more than 10 weeks (or having more than 10
lessons in a unit). However, they infrequently have &gt;= 100, so I
stick with this convention.

Additionally, there is a `optional-readings.md` file with each week.
These optional reading lists were provided by the course. They are
merely here for record, and not intended to be taken or stolen from the
course.

The `/reading` folder, as well, is my own notes on Barbara Oakley's
book, "A Mind for Numbers". In the future, I may extract this into
either a separate repository or a separate folder, but for now those
notes exist there.

Credits
-------

**All** credit is due towards Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for the
content in this section of the repository. All notes were taken from
their MOOC, and I am merely transcribing my own review of their lecture
material and resources. All my notes are heavily inspired and/or copied
fom their material.
