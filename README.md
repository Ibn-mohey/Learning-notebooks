# Collection of Course Notes

## Background

This is a collection of both my active and archived course notes. They are mostly for my personal use. However, I open-source them with the hope that someone may find them useful as well. 

I also maintain a list of [intended courses](https://github.com/schlomok/courses/blob/master/intended-courses.md). 

**Note**: I am not following a curriculum for any specific program. I have already completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and this is my attempt at broadening my horizons.

### About This Repository

The structure of this repository utilizes in the following pattern: `courses/{subject}/{course}/{...}`, where `{...}` is reflected by the structure of that specific course. Often, this structure is based on weeks.
