# Collection of Course Notes

## Background

This is a collection of both my active and archived course notes. They are mostly for my personal use. However, I open-source them with the hope that someone may find them useful as well, this originally was created by [schlomok](https://github.com/schlomok/notebook).

I also maintain a list of [intended courses](https://github.com/schlomok/courses/blob/master/intended-courses.md).

### About This Repository

The structure of this repository utilizes in the following pattern:
`notebook/{subject}/{program}/{course}/{...}`, where `{...}` is reflected by
the structure of that specific course. Often, this structure is based on weeks.
Sometimes, courses are not part of programs, however. In this case, they follow
`notebook/{subject}/{course}/{...}`.

| DataScience | [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/home/welcome) | [This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. We will cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.]() |[Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) | [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) | [Notes](https://github.com/Ibn-mohey/Exploratory-ana-project-R) | *June 17 2020* |
| Programing | [Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data/home/welcome) |This course will show how one can treat the Internet as a source of data.  We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs.  We will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.  This course will cover Chapters 11-13 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. To succeed in this course, you should be familiar with the material covered in Chapters 1-10 of the textbook and the first two courses in this specialization.  These topics include variables and expressions, conditional execution (loops, branching, and try/except), functions, Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples), and manipulating files.  This course covers Python 3.| [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) | [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) | [Notes](https://github.com/Ibn-mohey/py-practice-general-) | *July 1 2020* |
