They are mostly for my personal use. However, I open-source them with the hope that someone may find them useful as well. \r\n\r\nI also maintain a list of [intended courses](https://github.com/schlomok/courses/blob/master/intended-courses.md). \r\n\r\n**Note**: I am not following a curriculum for any specific program. I have already completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and this is my attempt at broadening my horizons.\r\n\r\n### About This Repository\r\n\r\nThe structure of this repository utilizes in the following pattern: `courses/{subject}/{course}/{...}`, where `{...}` is reflected by the structure of that specific course. Often, this structure is based on weeks.\r\n\r\n## Current Courses\r\n\r\n### Education\r\n\r\n| Course | School | Platform | Notes | Dates |\r\n|--------|--------|----------|-------|-------|\r\n| [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) | [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) | [Coursera](https://coursera.org/) | [Notes](https://github.com/schlomok/courses/tree/master/education/learning-how-to-learn) | *February 1 - March 6, 2016* |\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n### MOOC Platforms\r\n\r\n* [Coursera](https://coursera.org)\r\n* [edX](https://www.edx.org/)\r\n* [Future Learn](https://www.futurelearn.com/)\r\n* [MIT OpenCourseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/#electrical-engineering-and-computer-science)\r\n* [Stanford Online](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/)\r\n* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
