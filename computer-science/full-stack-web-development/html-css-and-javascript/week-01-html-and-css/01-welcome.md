Introduction to the Course
--------------------------

The internet is comprised of many servers and many browsers accessing
them. This course focuses on the **browser**.

This course is solely focused on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

-   HTML is the base.
-   CSS defines display rules for HTML.
-   Javascript can change CSS and HTML at any time.

Extra Notes
-----------

The course provides all presentation and example notes within the
Coursera site, so they are ommitted here.
