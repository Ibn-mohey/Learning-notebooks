# Chunking - The Essentials

## Illusions of competence in learning

* When you use ineffective study methods to fool your mind into thinking
  you are actually wasting time.

## What is a Chunk?

* Chunking is the mental leap that helps unite bits of info. through meaning.
* Helps allow you to move the chunk into how it fits with the bigger picture
* Focused mode is very important in being able to create chunks
* Stress/anger/fear prevents you from creating useful chunks
* One of the first steps in gaining academic expertise is to create conceptual
  chunks to start gaining meaning.
* A chunk means a network of neurons communicating with one another so you can
  focus effectively.
* The path to expertise is little-by-little - small chunks join larger chunks
  over time.
* Practice and repetition and building chunks aren't all you need.
* Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently.
* Once you've chunked, you have the main idea - you don't need the underlying
  details.

## How to Form a Chunk

* The point of chunking is to combine complex ideas into a single idea that
  doesn't require conscious thought.
* A concern about using worked-out examples to help start forming chunks is 
  that it can be too easy to focus on why an individual step works and not on
  the connection between steps.
* Chunking across subjects are different, but related. 
* Steps:
    1. Focus on the individual idea you want to chunk (undivided attention)
        - Distractions will cause more difficulty on creating a chunk
        - Your brain is creating new neural patterns. 
    2. Understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk.
        - Understanding is like a superglue to allow the chunks to stick 
          together.
        - Just understanding how a problem is solved does not necessarily 
          create a chunk that can be easily called to mind later.
        - You can grasp an idea in class, but if not reviewed, it might seem
          incomprehensible later.
        - Only doing something yourself help create underlying patterns.
    3. Gaining context
        - See not just how, but also when to use a chunk.
        - Viewing beyond the chunk and seeing more broadly.
        - See when to use the chunk, but also when to not use it.
        - Practice helps broaden the network of neurons to let you know when 
          the chunk should be used.
        - Bottom up learning (chunking)
        - Top down learning (big picture)
        - Context is when bottom-up and top-down learning meet.
        - Context is learning when to use a technique.
* Summary
    - Chunks are best built with: 
        1. Focused attention
        2. Understanding the idea
        3. Practice to gain a sense of mastery and big picture context.

## Illusions of Competence, the Importance of Recall, Mini-testing, and Making Mistakes

* Re-reading is not very productive. *Recall* is much more effective.
    - Look away after reading and see how much you can recall of it.
    - Re-study and recall again. 
* By simply practicing and recalling, students learned far more and at a much
  deeper level.
* When we retrieve knowledge, we are enhancing our deep learning. Helps create
  and strengthen our chunks.
* The only time re-reading is effective is if you let time pass, so you can 
  exercise spaced repetition.
* Once a concept is chunked, it only takes one of your four slots in your 
  working memory.
* Looking at a solution is not really useful if you have not tried.
* Highlighting and underlining should be scarce. 
* Margin writing is a **very** good idea, because it strengthens recall.
* **Illusions of Competence**: When you have a book in front of you, it's easy to 
  believe the content is in your brain. Spending a lot of time doesn't actually
  make sure you have it in your brain, but gives the illusion it is there.
    - A more effective method is to test yourself after reading something, 
      because then it forces you to practice recall.
* Mistakes are very helpful in self-tests, because they allow to make repairs 
  earlier, before those mistakes matter.
* Recalling material outside your usual place of study is very useful in 
  strengthening those ideas.
