# Memory

## Diving Deeper into Memory

* Memory is only a part of learning and developing expertise - but it is very
  important!
* The mind is built to retain general information about a place.
* We can expand our memory if we tap into this idea
* Try to make a very memorable mental image remembering one single idea
* Images connect to our right brain's visual scepters.
    - Brain naturally provides extra memory capability
* To get something to move from working memory to long-term, you need to
  create a memorable and repeatable memory.
* Repetition is extremely important - spaced repetition!
    - Index cards are one of the best ways.
* Handwriting does appear to more deeply encode ideas.
* The more you can turn something into something that is memorable, the more
  likely you are to remember it.
* Try to associate a new idea w/ a new image if possible. Be creative!
* Interleave by shuffling your cards and trying to go through them.
* Anki is well known to handle this.
* Remembering names
    - Try repeating the name at increasing time intervals immediately after
      learning the name.

## What is Long Term Memory?

* The hippocampus is a very important part of the brain that is extremely
  important in memory consolidation.
    - If this is damaged or removed, you cannot make new long term memories.
+ Think Memento or 50 First Dates.
* Memories are not fixed. They are living, breathing parts of the brain and
  often change.
* Whenever a memory is recalled, it changes, called "reconsolidation."
* It's possible to plant false memories, which are indistinguishable from real
  ones.
* Consolidation takes a short term memory memory into long-term by modifying
  synapses on the dendrites of neurons.
* These can be re-instated by "reactivation". 
* The re-activated memory (recalled) can be re-authored through reconsolidation
  and strengthen/change the memory.
* It's more effective to space learning over time because you are forcing
  reconsolidation to occur.
* Cramming only works for the day after an exam - but not long term.
* The astrocyte is the most abundant gleel cell in the brain.
* More astrocytes may very well be extremely be related to how we learn.

## Creating Memory Groups and the Memory Palace Technique

* A key to memorization is creating meaningful groups to help simplify the 
  material.
    - e.g. Suppose you need to think of the materials necessary to ward off
      vampires. You might think "Garlic, Rose, Hawthorn, and Mustard". The
      initials of each make "GRHM", so you may consider the word "GRaHaM", or
      an image of a "graham cracker".
* It's much easier to remember numbers by associating them with events.
* Mnemonics are extremely helpful (proven)
* See if there is a well-known memory trick for the subject you are studying.
* Memory Palace
    - Think of a place you are very familiar with
    - Useful for remembering unrelated items
        + Shopping list, for example
    - Walk in your mind through a place you know well with shockingly memorable
      images of what you want to remember.
    - Very useful with lists
    - Studies show that you can remember up to 90% after 1-2 walks of a 40-50
      item list.
* Research has shown that students that use these tricks outperform those who
  don't.
* Memory tricks allow people to expand their working memory
* These tricks often require a lot of practice

## Summing up memory

* Learning to use memory in a disciplined, yet creative, way helps move working
  memory into long-term memory more effectively.
* Two major memory ways:
    - Long-term memory
        + Like a storage warehouse
        + Spaced repetition helps retain these memories longer and give them
          more definition
    - Working memory
        + Like a chalkboard
        + Only 4 slots in our working memory
        + Mastering techniques can condense ideas to perhaps only fill up one
          slot instead of multiple.
* Visual Memory System
    - To tap into this, try creating a memorable image of what you are trying
      to remember. The funnier and more evocative, the better.
    - Repetition of this image over several days is recommended.
* Try remembering numbers with years or systems you are familiar with.
* Memorable sentences are useful to remember lists.
* Memory palaces are great ways to group unrelated items
* These different tricks can create smaller chunks which makes it easier to 
  store into working memory.
* Memorizing material you understand allows you to internalize material.
    - Crucial to become a master of the concepts.
