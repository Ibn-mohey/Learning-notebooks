# Optional Interviews

## Caroline on Learning Something Difficult that Others Think isn't "You"

* Broaden your passions instead of just following them.
* Always avoided mathematics but chose mech. engineering in college
* Ended up enjoying it
* It was very difficult

## Nelson Dellis - 4-time US Memory Champion

* Holds memory records
* Uses a self-taught memory system
* Trained memory techniques and lots of practice
* System to remember numbers
    - Numbers requires preparation
    - Creates several images for sets of numbers and memorizes those
* Remembering Names
    - Remember distinguishing features about the person
        + This creates an anchor
    - Get the name. 
    - Turn name into whatever it reminds you of
        + Friend with the same name
        + Cartoon character
        + Celebrity
        + Name that sounds like an object
        + etc.
    - Attach that picture to the person's distinguishing feature
    - Then, next time you see that feature of the person, you keep that anchor
* Memory techniques require two things:
    - Create image associated with the idea that has meaning to you
    - Attach that image to the idea
        + Possible w/ a memory palace
* Memorizing names rapidly
    - Requires a lot of time. 
    - Go talk to everyone you meet - spend initial time with them.
    - Be willing to ask again and don't worry about it. 
        + Don't ask a lot of times, but take the time to try again individually
* Memory is all about paying attention
* w/ People
    - Review after finished meeting them
    - Keep a file of the people and review (flash cards)
* To learn the memory systems, train different systems on different days
* Create a picture! **he mentioned this like 3 or 4 times**
* To memorize a text, consider just memorizing keywords and then remember those
    - If memorizing for learning, just remember those keywords
    - If memorizing perfectly, think of them as starting points
    - Turn into pictures and store in memory
* Brain Health
    - Keep brain active to keep brain health
    - Try learning new skills
    - Be physically active
    - Be social
    - Eat healthy
        + Omega 3 pills
* Be willing to be more creative and explore and creating new images
* "The Extreme Memory Challenge"
    - Attempting to find "naturally gifted" memorizers
    - Taking the course improves research on Alzheimer's and memory

## Dr. Robert Gamache, an Award-winning Bilingual Scientist

* We use english everyday, so we don't think about it. The same thing will
  happen with other subjects - if we study it everyday, it's just there.
    - If you study physics everyday, you will know physics very well (even
      if you just study 15 mins a day)
* Repetition hard-wires your brain - you can hardwire the brain to learn
  things, such as problem-solving.
* Try to always do the additional exercise; read available additional 
  resources. 
* What to do when you get stuck:
    - Deliberately take a break (sometimes a 5-10 min. break is all that's 
      needed; other times, he has to sleep)
* Balancing family and work life
    - If working all the time, you tend to not necessarily be productive
    - Being with family gives a chance to refresh the mind - make a point of
      doing this.
* Choose a career where you can do something that you love
    - Work hard at it
    - It's **very important** to have downtime.
        - If you work all the time, you get burnt out
        - The gears are turning in the background
* Sometimes it takes a little extra time to learn to love something
* Also, when you love something, it doesn't mean it doesn't take hard, grueling
  work sometimes
* Using examples in the classroom severely helps concrete ideas. It helps
  drive deep learning.

## Stanford's Dr. Keith Devlin, the NPR "Math Guy"

* Tackling math problems
    - First step: Don't panic
    - Ask:
        1. What are you trying to do?
        2. What do you want to achieve?
        3. What information do you have?
    - See if you can use a technique you already know, or maybe adapt one
    - If you don't know a technique that can work, start bashing away with
      naive approaches until you started making some headway.
        + If nothing happens over time, the best idea is to walk away.
            * Go running or biking for an hour or two
* Never solved a problem by sitting at a desk and looking at it.
* By definition, you can't solve something new if you are too focused and 
  approaching the wrong way.
    - The diffuse mode is the **only** way.
        + The brain sorts out problems 
* The diffuse mode only begins to start working if you really try spending the 
  time and put in hard work trying and failing beforehand.
* It's a slow process to learn mathematics
* Slow thinking is very important. Don't be embarassed by it.
* The reason why mathematics seems harder (or maybe is) is because it's more
  abstract. 
    - You have to create a world that we aren't really familiar with, which is
      opposite of problem solving in the social world.
* The hard part of math problems is getting familiar with the problem.
* Exercise helps you build neural structures to help learn better.
* Exercise
    - You are wholly focused on the activity in front of you, but behind you
      your subconscious is working very, very actively on the other problems.
    - If your body is tired, your mind is tired.
    - The mind and body are very connected.
    - **Physical activity plays a HUGE role in learning.**
* Multi-tasking
    - YOU CAN'T MULTI-TASK.
    - Instead, he serial tasks
        + Entire focus on one single thing at a time
        + Very intense focus (excludes everything else)
        + Then switch from one thing to another
* Starting something new sometimes introduces procrastination
    - Just use willpower at the cue, not at any other parts.
    - Willpower is a limited resource!
    - Just get started!
* **One thing is all you can focus on.**
* Tips
    - Turn off all alerts on computer/phone while working.
        + These distractions remove ability to wholly focus
