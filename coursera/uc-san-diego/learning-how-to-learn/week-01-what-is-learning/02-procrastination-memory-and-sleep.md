# Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

## A Procrastination Preview

1. When you procrastinate, you get a sensation of uneasiness or pain when you
  observe or anticipate the thing that causes pain.
2. Your brain automatically funnels attention to a more pleasant task.
3. You feel happier (temporarily).

* Pomodoro Technique
    - Proven to be extremely effective
    - Steps
        1. Set a timer to 25 minutes.
        2. Turn off all interruptions
        3. Focus.
        4. Reward for 5 minutes after.

## Practice Makes Permanent

* Math and science are often more abstract that humanities
    - Therefore it's more important to often practice these types of studies
      than other types of study.
* Neurons become linked together through repeated use.
* The more abstract an idea is, the more important it is to practice to link
  the synapses more concretely.
* e.g. How to solve a problem
    1. Generate a very faint neural pattern.
    2. Take a fresh variation fo the problem and it gets a little darker.
    3. Continuing to practice until you really understand it, and it gets very
       very dark. The pattern is easily recognizable and you don't need to 
       think about it so hard anymore.
* A little practice everyday helps build a very strong foundation (solid brick
  wall). 
* Cramming all night gives poor foundation (crumbling and poorly stacked wall).
* If suffering from procrastination, use the Pomodoro Technique to help focus 
  and tackle to-do items.

## Introduction to Memory

* When trying to hold a few ideas in mind to help solve a problem, this is
  using your working memory (short-term).
* Functionally, two main memories.
    - Working memory 
    - Long-term
* You can move long-term memories into working memory.
* Working memory only holds 4 chunks of items at a time.
* Working memory is very similar to an extremely small blackboard
* Repetition is necessary to make sure memories don't escape
* Long-term memory is like a storage warehouse
    - Distributed in different areas
    - A memory is stored, but sometimes hard to retrieve.
    - Necessary to practice and repeat finding older memories.
* Tech.: Spaced repetition
    - Repeat and practice an idea multiple times over several days (think
      Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday) or day patterns similar
    - Trying to repeat too many times in a single day doesn't stick as well in
      long-term memory than multiple, shorter stints over several days.
    - Make sure you let your synaptic connections to form and strength (mortar
      in a brick wall to dry), otherwise they don't stick long enough.

## The Importance of Sleep in Learning

* Being awake creates toxic products in your brain.
* When you sleep, your brain cells shrink. This causes gaps to create to allow
  toxins to escape.
* Sleep allows your brain to stay clean and healthy.
* Too little sleep over too long time causes many, many health issues and 
  mental issues.
* During sleep, your brain erases less-important memories and strengthens
  important memories.
    - Brain rehearses certain patterns it noticed during the day.
* Sleep lets portions of your brain to talk to each other.
* You can plant the seed of diffuse mode by doing focused mode first.
    - If you are going over what you are learning right before you sleep, you
      have an increased chance of dreaming about it.
    - If you set in mind that you want to dream about what you are studying,
      it goes further.
    - Dreaming about what you study helps you learn better. It helps the 
      information break down into easier-to-grasp chunks.

## Interview with Terrence Sejnowski

* Learning by doing is very effective. 
* Learn from experts.
* There isn't a simple way to stick with what you aren't interested in.
    - Ask questions to cause something to be more interesting.
* Active engagement > passive engagement.
* Exercise is a great way to disengage from the normal train of thought.
* Taking a notebook along with you is usually a good way to retain thoughts.
* You can't consciencely do multiple things at the same exact time.
* Multi-tasking is being able to context switch quickly.
* In the hippocampus, new neurons get created even in adulthood.
    - These help develop memories far better.
* Exercise helps actually create new neurons faster.
    - Recess is **extremely** necessary to help our bodies process better.
* Being in a creative environment where others are creative is a way of 
  enhancing creativity.
    - The isolated genius is not for everyone.
    - Usually bouncing ideas off others is very useful and very important to
      contribute to creativity.
* Tests are like any other skill - you can learn to be a better test taker.
    - Don't get hung up if you can't answer a question - skip to the next and
      come back later.
        + Diffuse mode may actually provide that answer later.
* Persistence and passion is often more important than pure intelligence.
    - Most skills and knowledge can be trained and learned.
* Different perspectives go a very long way.
